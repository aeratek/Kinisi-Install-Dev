Kinisi-Install-Dev
==================

This is a repository used to develop and test Kinisi installation scripts, as well as test pull/commits. NOTE: This repository will be deprecated shortly and superseded by install/config directories in the Kinisi-Main repository. 

Temporary Note: This git repo got messed up. The Postgresql-Configure.sh script should be run before the Postgresql-Users-DB-Create.sh script.
